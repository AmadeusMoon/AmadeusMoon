# Looking to make a change

### 📓 A little about myself before we move to stats

 I started coding to improve my life, it wasn't something I enjoyed from the start but something I grew to like and currently there are so many uses to coding I simply cannot quit it.
  
  I have stashes of projects that might never see the light of day, everytime I feel inspired I note things down, all though I might not know how to realize it or never will, the idea survives.

  Future goals are the C's and Rust, looking to work in the backend with a lot of data, I do like data but you know whats better than data ? Data put to use by efficient aplications.

 AI market's potential is unlimited, this tool minimizes costs and maximizes efficiency, looking to automatize data filters since the gathering is pretty much evolved, and train AI to both filter and feed itself information from that process, eventually the goal is to create a machine that understands its surroundings and use and given an input is able to generate a response, efficiently minimizing our time waste and maximizing efficiency allowing us to focus on creative and from time to time maintainance jobs.

### ❇ My drive ? 

Pure fantasy, freedom through evolution. But if we don't build it just because it sounds absurd, who will ?
