# Looking to make a change

### 📓 A little about myself before we move to stats

 I started coding to improve my life, it wasn't something I enjoyed from the start but something I grew to like and currently there are so many uses to coding I simply cannot quit it.
  
  I have stashes of projects that might never see the light of day, everytime I feel inspired I note things down, all though I might not know how to realize it or never will, the idea survives.

  Future goals are the C's and Rust, looking to work in the backend with a lot of data, I do like data but you know whats better than data ? Data put to use by efficient aplications.

### ❇ My drive ? 

Pure fantasy, freedom through evolution. But if we don't build it just because it sounds absurd, who will ?
