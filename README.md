## 📓 A little about myself before we move to stats

 I started coding to improve my life, I grew to like it and currently there are so many uses to coding I simply cannot quit it.
  
  I have stashes of projects that might never see the light of day, everytime I feel inspired I note things down, although I might not know how to realize it or never will, the ideas survive.

  Future goals are the Cs and Rust, looking to work in the backend with a lot of data, I do like data but you know what's better than data? Data put to use by efficient applications.

### 🎇 My drive 

Pure fantasy, freedom through evolution. But if we don't build it just because it sounds absurd, who will?
